# Caesar Cipher

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher project! üéâ

## Overview

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. Named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate securely with his generals, this cipher shifts each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This project is a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, allowing you to encode and decode messages with ease.

## Features

- **Encoding**: Encrypt messages by shifting letters forward in the alphabet.
- **Decoding**: Decrypt messages by shifting letters backward in the alphabet.
- **Customizable Shift**: Choose your shift number to customize the encryption and decryption.

## How It Works

1. **Encryption**: The `encrypt` function shifts each letter of the message by the specified number of positions in the alphabet. Characters not in the alphabet are preserved.
2. **Decryption**: The `decrypt` function reverses the encryption process by shifting letters back to their original positions.
